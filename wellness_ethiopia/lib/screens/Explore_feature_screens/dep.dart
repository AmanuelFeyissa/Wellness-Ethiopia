<h1 class="">What Is Depression?</h1>
<div class="c-article__body--h2">
<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.</p>
<p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
<li>Changes in appetite &mdash; weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
<li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)</li>
<li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
<li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.</p>

<h4>Generalised anxiety disorder</h4>
<p>The essential feature of GAD is excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring on more days than not for a period of at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities. The person with GAD finds it difficult to control the anxiety and worry, which is often accompanied by restlessness, being easily fatigued, having difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension and disturbed sleep .</p>
<p>The focus of the anxiety and worry in GAD is not confined to features of another disorder, for example having panic attacks (as in panic disorder) or being embarrassed in public (as in social anxiety disorder). Some people with GAD may become excessively apprehensive about the outcome of routine activities, in particular those associated with the health of or separation from loved ones. Some people often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or a side effect of medication. Demoralisation is said to be a common consequence, with many individuals becoming discouraged, ashamed and unhappy about the difficulties of carrying out their normal routines. GAD is often comorbid with depression and this can make accurate diagnosis problematic .</p>
