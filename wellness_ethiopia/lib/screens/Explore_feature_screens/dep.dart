<h1 class="">What Is Depression?</h1>
<div class="c-article__body--h2">
<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.</p>
<p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
<li>Changes in appetite &mdash; weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
<li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)</li>
<li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
<li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.</p>
